= Hashtable with open addressing

This library provides a simple hashtable written in C. The hashtable is stored
as a single heap allocated array. This storage scheme is good for caching, since
everything is densely packed and pointer chasing is avoided in contrast to hashtables which use linked lists.
The array will grow automatically, when the filling reaches a certain threshold.

By using macros, the library is specialized for each entry type. For example
it is possible to generate a hashset without overhead, by using entries consisting only of a key.
Arbitrary key types are supported and various hash functions are provided in link:hashfn.h[].

== Configure the hash table

[source,c]
----
typedef struct {
    const char* k;
    int         v;
} Entry;

#define HASH        Hash
#define ENTRY       Entry
#define PREFIX      hash
#define KEY(e)      e->k
#define EXISTS(e)   e->k
#define KEYEQ(a, b) !strcmp(a, b)
#define HASHFN      hashString
#include "hash.h"

== Usage

[source,c]
----
int main(void) {
    Hash hash = HASH_INIT;

    Entry* e;

    if (hashCreate(&hash, "a", &e)) {
        printf("ENTRY CREATED\n");
        e->k = "a";
        e->v = 1;
    }

    hashCreate(&hash, "b", &e);
    e->k = "b";
    e->v = 2;

    hashCreate(&hash, "c", &e);
    e->k = "c";
    e->v = 3;

    hashCreate(&hash, "c", &e);
    e->k = "c";
    e->v = 4;

    e = hashFind(&hash, "a");
    if (e)
        printf("FOUND a %d\n", e->v);
    else
        printf("NOT FOUND a\n");

    e = hashFind(&hash, "d");
    if (e)
        printf("FOUND d %d\n", e->v);
    else
        printf("NOT FOUND d\n");

    HASH_FOREACH(hash, f, &hash)
        printf("%s %d\n", f->k, f->v);
}
